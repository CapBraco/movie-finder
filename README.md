# Movie Explorer ðŸŽ¬

**Movie Explorer** is a React-based web application that allows users to browse movies by genre, watch featured trailers, and view detailed movie information. The app consumes The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch real-time movie data and trailers, showcasing a responsive and user-friendly interface.
